## Hi there! 👋  

My name is Hrishikesh (aka Rishi), and I'm a Computer Science Master’s graduate from ETH Zurich specializing in Artificial Intelligence — because regular intelligence just wasn’t challenging enough.

### About Me
- 🤖 I'm fascinated by how abstract systems can be trained to mimic human intelligence.  
- 🛠️ A big fan of uncovering where AI can make the biggest impact, creating smart applications that turn workflows into something **practically magical**.
- 🌍 A firm believer in ethical AI, exploring ways to ensure responsible use of technology while addressing challenges like **AI Safety** and **AI Fairness**.

### For Fun:  
🎮 I developed a game that’s available on [itch.io](https://mytombstone.itch.io/toa) — it has absolutely nothing to do with AI, but it’s full of fun! Check it out!

### What I’m Looking For:  
🔍 I thrive in interdisciplinary projects — whether it’s blending AI with finance, healthcare, or anything that pushes boundaries!

### Let's Connect!  
✨ Let’s build something awesome and maybe save the world from bad AI… one algorithm at a time!
